# Requirements

- Python == 3.7 or 3.8
- tensorflow == 2.X (both for CPU and GPU)
- PyRiemann >= 0.2.5
- scikit-learn >= 0.20.1
- matplotlib >= 2.2.3

# Models implemented/used
- EEGNet [1](http://stacks.iop.org/1741-2552/15/i=5/a=056013). Both the original model and the revised model are implemented.
- DeepConvNet [[3]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.23730)
- ShallowConvNet [[3]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.23730)

EEGNet, DeepConvNet, and ShallowConvNet implementation are based on EEGNet repo [[4]](https://github.com/vlawhern/arl-eegmodels)
